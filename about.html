        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>Who are we?</h3>
        <p>Refugee's Havn is a student-created and led voluntary association. Our vision is to alleviate the problems of refugees all around the world, however we recognize our abilities and have put a focus in Denmark. Although, we are small, we are determined to help the refugees, even if it is just one person, as we beleive we will have created an actual impact.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Aim</h3>
        <p>We as a group aim to not only help the refugees financially, but also socially. We hope to be able to create communities within the refugees, and to make the new refugees feel more welcome as their long journy comes to an end. We believe that refugees should be welcomed, and not discouraged against, as that is not how Danish people are. Danish people are kind and caring, and we all have to show this kindness to the refugees. </p>
        <p>Any money donated towards this NGO will be greatly appreciated, as every kroner counts. 100% of the money will be well spent, and we hope to be able to demonstrate this, through our commitment and the out come of this project.</p>
        <p>We highly encourage all of to <a href="donate.html">donate</a> some amount of money, even if it is just 1 kr. In addition, if you have any sort of feedback or ways to improve either our NGO or website, then please feel free to email us at: <a href="mailto:refugeeshavn@gmail.com">refugeeshavn@gmail.com</a> or <a href="mailto:madhan2024@ish.dk">madhan2024@ish.dk</a>.</p>
